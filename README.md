Use this template to create new prototypes in DWP. This template is updated with every major version release of the GOVUK prototype kit. 

Best practice:<br>
<br>
Run npm audit regularly<br>
Keep package-lock.json under version control<br>
Do not blindly update packages without review<br>
Never connect to internal APIs or production systems<br>
Never store or process real user data<br>
Remove old or unused prototypes promptly<br>
Document the purpose and owner of each prototype clearly<br>
Avoid turning prototypes into live services<br>
Do not allow open write access to external collaborators<br>
