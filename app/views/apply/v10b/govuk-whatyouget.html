    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-padding-top-3 govuk-!-font-size-27">What you'll get</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can get financial support and work-related support through Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-padding-top-3">Financial support</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll normally get the assessment rate for 13 weeks after your claim. This will be:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>up to £57.90 a week if you’re aged under 25</li>
      <li>up to £73.10 a week if you’re aged 25 or over</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">After that, if you’re entitled to ESA, you’ll be placed in one of 2 groups and will receive:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>up to £73.10 a week if you’re in the work-related activity group</li>
      <li>up to £110.75 a week if you’re in the support group</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      You might get more ESA in the work-related activity group if you applied before 3 April 2017.
    </div>
    <p class="govuk-body">You may also qualify for the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">disabiity premium</a> at £64.30 per week.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If the assessment takes longer than 13 weeks your benefit will be backdated to the 14th week of the claim.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-3">The benefit cap</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">The <a href="">benefit cap</a> limits the total amount of benefit you can get. It applies to most people aged 16 or over who have not reached State Pension age.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Some individual benefits are not affected, but it may affect the total amount of benefit you get. The cap will not affect you if you’re in the support group.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-padding-top-3">Work related support</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Following your <a href="#" class="govuk-link">work capability assessment</a> you’ll be placed in either the work-related activity group or support group if you’re entitled to ESA.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-3">Work related activity group</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">You must go to regular interviews with an adviser who can help with things like job goals and improving your skills.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-3">Support group</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">You do not have to go to interviews, but you can ask to talk to a personal adviser. You’re usually in this group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-padding-top-3">How long you'll get ESA for</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">‘New style’ and contribution-based ESA last for 365 days if you’re in the work-related activity group.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">There’s no time limit if you’re in the support group, or if you’re getting income-based ESA.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-padding-top-3">Benefit sanctions</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Your ESA can be reduced if you do not go to interviews or do work-related activity as agreed with your adviser. This reduction can continue for up to 4 weeks after you restart the interviews or activity.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll get a ‘sanction letter’. Tell your ESA adviser if you have a good reason for missing the interview.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll get another letter if the decision is made to give you a sanction. Your benefit will only be affected once a decision has been made.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You should <a href="#" class="govuk-link">contact your local council immediately</a> if you claim Housing Benefit or Council Tax Reduction. They’ll tell you what to do to continue getting support.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you get a sanction you can:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><a href="#" class="govuk-link">ask for the decision to be looked at again</a></li>
      <li>ask for a ‘hardship payment’</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      You will not get a sanction if you’re in the support group.
    </div>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-padding-top-3">Hardship payments</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">You may be able to get a hardship payment if your income-related ESA has been reduced because of a sanction or <a href="#" class="govuk-link">fraud penalty.</a> You do not have to pay it back.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">A hardship payment is a reduced amount of your ESA (usually 60% or 80% of the basic rate, depending on your circumstances).</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Eligibility</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can get a hardship payment if you cannot pay for rent, heating, food or other basic needs for you or your family.</p>
