    <p class="govuk-body">We will contact you by <span class="new-date"></span>. We will book you a ‘Claimant Commitment’ appointment, which is normally over the phone - unless you have told us you need an alternative format.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We'll talk to you about what you need to do to get New Style ESA, including
      asking you to:</p>

    <p>You can self-certify for the first 7 days of your claim but you need to send us medical evidence from day 8
      onwards.</p>
    <p>The most common type of medical certificate is a fit note (also called a statement of fitness for work or a sick

        <p>Other forms of evidence might include a doctor’s statement, consultant’s report or Local Authority notice.

      </div>
    </details>

    <p>You will need to keep sending us medical evidence as long as you’re unfit for work. We will tell you when you can
      stop sending it. For example, if your fit note is for 14 days, you will need to send us another one when it runs
      out.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Send us evidence that you’re self-isolating to support your application</h3>

    <p>There are different instructions depending on the reason you're self-isolating.</p>

    <p>Send us your evidence as soon as you can so we can process your claim.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">If you’re self-isolating (but not for surgery)</h4>

    <p>You can get an <a href="https://111.nhs.uk/isolation-note/">‘isolation note’ online from NHS 111 (opens in new
        tab)</a> if any of the following apply:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>you’re self-isolating because you have symptoms of coronavirus</li>
      <li>you’re self-isolating because you came into contact with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus</li>
      <li>you were told to self-isolate by a test and trace service</li>
      <li>you’re in quarantine because you’re returning from a trip abroad</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You do not have to go to your doctor or a hospital.</p>

    <p>Your isolation note will have a 16-digit reference number. We will contact you about your claim and
      take this reference number from you.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">If you’re self-isolating because you have surgery</h4>

    <p>If you’ve been advised by your doctor or healthcare professional to self-isolate before going into hospital for
      surgery, your letter confirming the date of your procedure is proof. Send us a copy of your appointment letter.
    </p>

    <p>If you do not have a printed copy of your letter or cannot leave your home to post it, your local council might
      be able to help. Go to GOV.UK to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus-local-help">find coronavirus help in your

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Do you need help with housing costs or support for a partner or child?</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you‘re on a low income or out of work, you can apply for Universal Credit as part of a dual
      claim with New Style ESA.</p>

    <p>Unlike New Style ESA, you can apply with a partner and get support for housing costs, children and childcare.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you get or have applied for Universal Credit, you will need to tell them that you’ve
      applied for New Style ESA. You can do this by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sign-in-universal-credit"
        target="_blank">signing in to your Universal Credit account (opens in new tab)</a> and using the journal to
      contact your case manager.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You must also enter details from your medical evidence into your Universal Credit account. For
      example, if you have a fit note, you do not need to send it to Universal Credit, but you must enter the dates.</p>
