<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Ask your doctor to add you to the shielded patients list</h2>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Get medical evidence to support your application</h2>

<p>You can self-certify for the first 7 days of your claim but you need to send us medical evidence from day 8 onwards.</p>
<p>The most common type of medical certificate is a fit note (also called a statement of fitness for work or a sick note), but we also accept other types of medical evidence.</p>

    <p id="other-medical-evidence-hint">As well as fit notes, we also accept these medical certificates:
      
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Med10 (a hospital certificate given to inpatients if your treatment lasts more than 7 days)</li>
  <li>MATB1 (if you’re pregnant but you cannot get Statutory Maternity Pay or Maternity Allowance)</li>
  <li>CF73 (a form issued by a psychiatric hospital)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other forms of evidence might include a doctor’s statement, consultant’s report or Local Authority notice.</p>

</div>
</details>

<p>You will need to keep sending us medical evidence as long as you’re unfit for work. We will tell you when you can stop sending it. For example, if your fit note is for 14 days, you will need to send us another one when it runs out.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">3. Send your evidence to DWP</h2>

<p>If you have a fit note, you can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/send-fit-note" target="_blank">Send Your Fit Note service (opens in a new window)</a> to send it to us online.</p>

<p>If you have another form of medical evidence, you can send it to us by post. You can also post your fit note.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">5. If you get Universal Credit, tell them</h3>
