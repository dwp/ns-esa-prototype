    Using this service
  </h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    This service is run by the Department for Work and Pensions. We want as 
    many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, 
    that means you should be able to:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
      change colours, contrast levels and fonts
    </li>
    <li>
      zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
    </li>
    <li>
      get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard
    </li>
    <li>
      get from the start of the service to the end using speech recognition 
      software
    </li>
    <li>
      listen to the service using a screen reader
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    We&rsquo;ve also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a>

  </p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
    How accessible this service is
  </h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The service is using common styles, patterns and components from the 
    GOV.UK Design System which are widely regarded as accessible.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Some people may find parts of this service difficult to use:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
    <li>if you say “new tab” to some voice control software, it opens the feedback link instead of opening a new tab
    </li>
    <li>error messages are sometimes not read out in JAWS versions 18 and 19</li>
    <li>	headings are sometimes not read out in JAWS versions 18 and 19 and ZoomText. This is a known issue with Freedom Scientific software. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://github.com/FreedomScientific/VFO-standards-support/issues/100">more about the issue with headings on GitHub</a>
    </li>
    <li>text is sometimes repeated by ZoomText&rsquo;s DocReader and SpeakIt tools
    </li>
    <li>reading zones sometimes move around the page when scrolling with ZoomText. This might cause a problem with the consent question pages, as well as the ‘check your answers’ and ‘what happens next’ pages, where there is lots of text
    </li>
    <li>visually hidden text for change links is read without spaces by JAWS versions 18 and 19 
    </li>
  
  </ul>
