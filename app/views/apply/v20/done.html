    {# BAU Evidence #}
  

    <p class="govuk-body">We will contact you by <span class="new-date"></span>. We will book you a ‘Claimant Commitment’ appointment, unless your Health Practitioner has informed you that you have less than 12 months to live. This is normally over the phone - unless you have told us you need an alternative format.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We'll talk to you about what you need to do to get New Style ESA, including
      asking you to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>explain how your illness or disability affects your ability to work</li>
      <li>provide medical evidence</li>
      <li>agree to tell us if your circumstances change</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">You must agree to your Claimant Commitment before you can get New Style ESA.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Send us medical evidence to support your application</h3>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Temporary change</h4>
      <p>You will not need to provide medical evidence, including fit notes to cover the dates between 17 December 2021 and 26 January 2022. Do not ask your doctor for one.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You can self-certify for the first 7 days of your claim but you need to send us medical evidence from day 8
      onwards.</p>
    <p>The most common type of medical certificate is a fit note (also called a statement of fitness for work or a sick
      note), but we also accept other types of medical evidence.</p>

        <p id="other-medical-evidence-hint">As well as fit notes, we also accept these medical certificates:

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Med10 (a hospital certificate given to inpatients if your treatment lasts more than 7 days)</li>
          <li>MATB1 (if you’re pregnant but you cannot get Statutory Maternity Pay or Maternity Allowance)</li>
          <li>CF73 (a form issued by a psychiatric hospital)</li>
          <li>SR1 (a form completed and sent to us by a doctor, consultant or specialist nurse if they think you might not live longer than 12 months because of your condition)
            Other forms of evidence might include a doctor’s statement, consultant’s report or Local Authority notice.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Other forms of evidence might include a doctor’s statement, consultant’s report or Local Authority notice.
        </p>
        <p>Just so you know, DS1500 forms are currently being replaced and your clinician should give you an SR1 form instead.<a href="#">Read why DS1500 forms are being phased out</a>.</p>

      </div>
    </details>

    <p>You will need to keep sending us medical evidence as long as you’re unfit for work. We will tell you when you can
      stop sending it. For example, if your fit note is for 14 days, you will need to send us another one when it runs
      out.</p>



    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to send your evidence</h3>

    <p>If you have a fit note, you can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/send-fit-note" target="_blank">Send Your Fit
        Note service (opens in tab)</a> to send it to us online.</p>

    <p>If you have another form of medical evidence, you can send it to us by post. You can also post your fit note.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Do you need help with housing costs or support for a partner or child?</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you‘re on a low income or out of work, you can apply for Universal Credit as part of a dual
      claim with New Style ESA.</p>

    <p>Unlike New Style ESA, you can apply with a partner and get support for housing costs, children and childcare.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You or your partner must have less than £16,000 in savings or investments to be eligible.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Tell Universal Credit</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you get or have applied for Universal Credit, you will need to tell them that you’ve
      applied for New Style ESA. You can do this by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sign-in-universal-credit"
        target="_blank">signing in to your Universal Credit account (opens in new tab)</a> and using the journal to
      contact your case manager.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You must also enter details from your medical evidence into your Universal Credit account. For
      example, if you have a fit note, you do not need to send it to Universal Credit, but you must enter the dates.</p>
