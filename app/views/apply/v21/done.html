    <p class="govuk-body">You can self-certify for the first 7 days of your claim but after that you need to send us medical evidence. Your claim start date is 1 December 2023, so you need to provide medical evidence from 8 December 2023 onwards.</p>
   

    <p class="govuk-body">Medical evidence always needs to be up-to-date, so send us a new one when it expires. You need to keep doing this as long as you're unfit for work.</p>
