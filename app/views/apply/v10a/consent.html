  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How DWP uses this information</h2>
  <p>DWP needs information about your health condition and how it affects you. This is to help them decide whether you are able to work or if you can get Employment and Support Allowance.</p>
  <p>If you agree, your doctor will know they are legally allowed to share this information.</p>
  <p>The law allows DWP to get, keep, and use this information for the purpose of processing and making a decision on your claim and on any mandatory reconsideration or appeal that you've made.</p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you change your mind</h2>
  <p>You can change your mind at any time. If you do, DWP will not ask your doctor to share any more information.</p>
  <p>Call 0800 169 0310 and say you want to give or withdraw your consent.</p>
