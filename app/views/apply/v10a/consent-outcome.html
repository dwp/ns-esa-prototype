            Sharing the outcome of an assessment with your doctor
            </h1>
            <p>DWP would like to share the decision made based on the result of your Work Capability Assessment (WCA) with your doctor, or any doctor treating you. This will help them, as it will tell them when they no longer need to provide you with Statements of Fitness for Work (also known as fit notes or medical certificates) for the purposes of this claim.</p>
            <p>We need your agreement to do this.</p>
            <p>You don't have to give your agreement. If you don't agree it won't affect your claim for ESA. We will keep a record of the decision you make.</p>
            <p>You can withdraw your agreement at any time before we contact your doctor by calling DWP on 0800 169 0310. If you withdraw your agreement, we will not share the decision based on the outcome of your WCA with your doctor. However, this will not affect the way in which DWP uses your information.</p>
