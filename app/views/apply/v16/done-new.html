  <p>There are different instructions depending on whether you have a letter or text message from the government or NHS.</p>

  <p>Send us your evidence as soon as you can so we can process your claim.</p>
  
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">If you’re shielding because you got a letter or text message from the government or NHS</h4>

    <li>you live in an area with local restrictions that include advice to ‘shield’</li>
    <li>you or your child need to ‘shield’ (take extra precautions to reduce contact with others) because you’re at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The letter will include the period you or your child should shield for. It is proof of your eligibility for ESA for days away from work in that period.</p>

  <p>You may get more than one letter covering more than one shielding period.</p>

    <li>you’ve previously been advised to ‘shield’ (take extra precautions to reduce contact with others) because you’re at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus</li>
    <li>you live in England</li>

  <p>Your shielding note will be valid for 3 weeks from the date you apply. If the note expires and you still need to shield, you will need to apply for another note. It will no longer be valid if local restrictions are lifted in the area you work in.</p>
