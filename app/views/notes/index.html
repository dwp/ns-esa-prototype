    It provides the main route through to the service and reassures the user that they are about to apply for the right thing.
    ',
    future:
    '
    We have requested the public beta start page from GDS and have shared with them the research that led us to this design. For private beta we may have to add a warning that the service is private (in case people find the link online) but we will wait until evidence shows that this is needed.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Before you start',
    screenshot: 'before-you-start',
    why:
    '
   At the moment there is no ‘save and return’ functionality. This means that users need to get certain documents ready before they start as they will not be able to leave their application.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To test whether users get everything ready before they begin. Would be good to see how many users exited on this page and how long people stayed on it.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Name',
    screenshot: 'Name',
    why:
    '
    To match up their application to existing records in CIS and JSAPS. The name is broken into forename and surname because it needs to match the equivalent JSAPS fields.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To consider whether asking for first name and last name separately is understood by users and whether it limits anyone with multiple surnames or a name that is presented differently. At the moment we accept all characters here but JSAPS does not - this might affect future correspondence.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Date of birth',
    screenshot: 'Date-of-birth',
    why:
    '
    To check if users are under State Pension age and over 16 years old.
    ',
    future:
    '
To check the accessibility of the date input. Some services have reported issues with things like Voiceover and Jaws. It‘s not tabbing as people expect. This should come out in the accessibility testing.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'National Insurance number',
    screenshot: 'NINO',
    why:
    '
    To check the user’s National insurance record and determine if they have paid enough to be eligible for the benefit.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To monitor how long people spend on this page and how many make mistakes users make. It might tell us whether they did not have their National Insurance number ready.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Address',
    screenshot: 'Address',
    why:
    '
    To find out where we should send their correspondence, to check their details against CIS, and to work out if they are resident in the UK.

    To check that users understand what we will use their address for and that it does not affect other services.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Mobile number',

    why:
    '
    So we can send text message alerts to claimants or call them if there are any processing queries.

    title: 'Another contact number',
    screenshot: 'Another-number',
    why:
    '
    To offer an alternative to mobile numbers for those who do not have them or do not want to use them. Users will only see this if they select no on the previous screen.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To monitor how many people get to this page and use this research to inform how we ask about contact preferences later in private beta. A mobile number is preferred by Operations and Policy so we can send text message alerts.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Health conditions',
    screenshot: 'Health-condition-1',
    why:
    '
    To find out what is limiting their ability to work, and build up context for the processors and decision makers.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To test if people know which conditions are relevant and that they can add more than one. In particular we want to look at what they put in the ‘condition start date’ field as previous research has shown that this is hard to answer and a precise date is difficult (DD MM YYYY is a JSAPS requirement). We also need to improve the accessibility of the ‘add another’ pattern, which isn’t clear when you’re using a screen reader. There are two alternative designs that we have tested with one  screen reader user. Details can be found at:<br><a href="https://add-another.herokuapp.com/">add-another.herokuapp.com</a><br>(username: add-another, password: rehtona-dda).

    why:'So we can contact their doctor for more information about their health, if they give consent to it later.',
    future:'To check if users understand why we ask for these details. And to check if people know their doctor’s name. We also need to explore whether people struggle at all with the address. Some services have tried a GP look up.'

  {
    title: 'Terminal illness',
    screenshot: 'Terminal-illness',
    why:
    '
   Claimants who have less than 6 months to live qualify for ‘special rules’. This means they go straight into the support group and their claim is prioritised.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To continue to test reactions to the question. Our decision to opt for less ambiguous wording (setting out what the special rules are, not referencing ‘terminal illness’ as that might be longer than 6 months) has tested quite well so far and been taken up by UC. We might want to explore whether ‘could live less’ is better than ‘expects you to live less’; UC have found some users prefer wording that is less definite.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'DS1500 form',
    screenshot: 'DS1500',
    why:
    '
   To prompt users who are eligible for a special rules claim that they need to have this form. Doctors send DS1500s to us to confirm that a claimant has a severe life-limiting condition.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To explore reactions to this question and monitor whether their DS1500 arrives. There are some existing issues with doctors not returning DS1500s. Some work done by the Work and Pensions Select Committee found that doctors were reluctant to define someone’s life expectancy and did not understand the impact of not sending the DS1500.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Staying in hospital',
    screenshot: 'Hospital',
    why:
    '
    To find out whether they may not be able to attend their appointment and to identify the doctors who may be able to provide more information about their condition. Claimants are also treated as having limited capability for work on days they are in hospital, but are only entitled a certain number of months before they are moved to the lower rate. This is why we ask for the admission date.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To test whether people understand ’inpatient’ or if they give details of repeat day visits for treatment. As with all dates, we need to test whether they can identify the correct date and also whether the date input is fully accessible.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Pregnant',
    screenshot: 'Pregnant',
    why:
    '
   Pregnancy may affect the severity of a condition (for example, high blood pressure). It might also mean they will be eligible for Statutory Maternity Pay in a few months time, which they cannot get alongside ESA.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To see if we can hide this question if it is appropriate or would cause distress. For example, anyone who has indicated that they have had a miscarriage or still birth, or if they have listed conditions that indicate they are certainly male. We want to avoid asking people to identify their sex if we can. As with all dates, we also need to check they know what to put and whether the date input is accessible.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Doctor’s consent',
    screenshot: 'Doctors-consent',
    why:
    '
    Doctors cannot share medical information with us without their patients consent. This question collects their consent on their doctor’s behalf.
    ',
    future:
    '
     This has taken a lot of work and involved a lot of internal and external stakeholders. Because of the sign off required, it went into the service just before private beta began so we have not had time to test the content properly. There is a lot more content than we would usually provide, and some phrasing could be clearer.  In particular we need to check they understand who they are giving consent to (since it isn’t us), what will happen if they say yes, what will happen if they say no, how they can change their response, and why we ask for it. We have agreed with colleagues in Strategy, Legal, Comms and Data Protection that we will test comprehension fully during private beta and if necessary try out new designs. Whatever we redesign will need to be signed off through the Customer Communications team, and will likely need to go to their senior civil servant for a final check. We agreed that we would keep all internal stakeholders informed of any research findings, and share any designs we are testing. Ideally we should work with the Comms team as soon as possible so changes are not coming in from them later on before they send it for sign off. They may have to implement similar changes to the clerical form as well.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Voluntary work',
    screenshot: 'Voluntary-work',
    why:
    '
  To find out if they are doing any unpaid work. Users are allowed to do voluntary work at the same time as claiming New Style ESA, but we would want to check that they are not doing work that they should be paid for. We did ask about this at the same time as paid work, but this confused users.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To explore whether users understand what we mean by ‘voluntary work’ and whether there is a distinction in users’ minds between volunteering and just helping someone out without being paid.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Voluntary work details',
    screenshot: 'Voluntary-work-details',
    why:
    '
   To find out who they are working for and how we can contact them. Information they give here also populates later questions to give context.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To test whether users understand that they can add more than one role from the hint text and to check that they know all this information and how we will use it.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Type of voluntary work',
    screenshot: 'What-voluntary-work',
    why:
    '
   To see what type of work they are doing and whether it should be paid.
    ',
    future:
    '
    Check what people put in the free text field and how processors interpret it.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Voluntary hours',
    screenshot: 'Voluntary-hours',
    why:
    '
   There is no strict limit to the number of hours they can volunteer, but if they work a lot of hours a week a decision maker might look into it to decide if should be voluntary work.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To see whether most users select ‘no’, and look into whether we need to capture the last 5 weeks of hours if they do.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Other voluntary work',
    screenshot: 'Other-voluntary-work',
    why:
    '
   First looping question. Plays back what the user has entred and asks if they want to go back and add another.
    ',
    future:
    '
 We have an alternative design for the ‘add another’ pattern to make it more accessible and easier to manage. We still need to test it.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Work',
    screenshot: 'Work',
    why:
    '
   If they have a job, even if they are off sick at the moment, we need to ask them further questions about how much they work and earn.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To test the comprehension of the question, particularly for self employed users. Self employed people struggle to answer this if they are not in a contract right now.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Employment details',
    screenshot: 'Employment-details',
    why:
    '
   To find out where they work so we can contact their employer, if needed.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To see if self employed people know what to put - some have put their client’s details in testing, rather than their own company details. We also need to test whether users understand they can add further jobs later and that they can add foreign employers confidently.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Off sick',
    screenshot: 'Off-sick',
    why:
    '
   People who are off sick do not need to answer all the questions about hours and pay so this branches those users away from the next work questions.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To test whether the term ‘off sick’ is clear to non-native English speakers. It has tested well with native speakers but he may be too colloquial for anyone who does not have English as a first language.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Date you last worked',
    screenshot: 'Last-work',
    why:
    '
    Only users who are off sick see this question. This tells us how long they have been ill, and whether they should still be receiving Statutory Sick Pay.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To explore whether users know the exact date. As with all other date inputs, we need to check whether there are any accessibility issues.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Employment status',
    screenshot: 'Employment-status',
    why:
    '
   This prompts processors or decision makers to look into whether they should be paid or be paying themselves Statutory Sick Pay.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To test whether people can identify their own employment status, particularly if they do contract, zero hours, or freelance work.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Work hours',
    screenshot: 'Hours-work',
    why:
    '
   To work out if their work is allowed. If they work less than 16 hours a week then they are still entitled to claim.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To look at how many users say no. It has currently been designed so that people who work irregular hours don’t have to guess a figure or give an average. We agreed this would be picked up by processors. As private beta continues, we might need to look at asking them for the hours they have worked over the last 5 weeks.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Earnings - for people who work regular hours',
    screenshot: 'Earnings-regular',
    why:
    '
   To find out if they earn more than the earnings limit.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To check whether we need all the frequency options or whether we can reduce the list a little.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Earnings - for people who do not work regular hours',
    screenshot: 'Earnings-irregular-hours',
    why:
    '
   To ask anyone who does not have regular hours, what they earned in their last pay so we can check if it was over the earnings limit. There will also need to be a conversation with a processor or a decision maker.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To check whether this is the best way to find out whether they earn less than the limit. We might have to look at how much they got paid each week over the last 5 weeks.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Professional support worker',
    screenshot: 'Professional-support-worker',
    why:
    '
   Claimants can work more than 16 hours a week if they have support from a professional support worker.
    ',
    future:
    '
    At the moment everyone sees this question. We might want to test branching users who have indicated they work more than 16 hours.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Expenses',
    screenshot: 'Expenses',
    why:
    '
  Some of their expenses may be classed as earnings.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To test whether users get everything ready before they begin. Would be good to see how many users exited on this page and how long people stayed on it.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Expenses details',
    screenshot: 'What-are-expenses-for',
    why:
    '
   To help decision makers and processors to work out if the expenses count as earnings.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To find out if only certain expenses count. If so, we can try presenting them to the user in a list and asking them to select the ones they get.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Other paid work',
    screenshot: 'Other-paid-work',
    why:
    '
   Second looping question. Plays back the employment they have just added and brings the user back to the start of the paid work section if they have more than one job.
    ',
    future:
    '
     We have an alternative design for the ‘add another’ pattern to make it more accessible and easier to manage. We still need to test it.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Statutory Sick Pay',
    screenshot: 'SSP',
    why:
    '
   You cannot get Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) at the same time as New Style ESA, unless your SSP is due to finish in the next 3 months. This question prompts the next question about when their SSP will end so we can decide if the claimant is eligible.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To check that users understand what Statutory Sick Pay is and how it relates to the benefit.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Statutory Sick Pay end date (if date is in the future)',
    screenshot: 'When-does-SSP-end',
    why:
    '
   To work out if their SSP will end in the next 3 months. If not, they are not eligible for the benefit.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To test whether users have SSP1 forms (which show the end date), and if they do, whether they understand that the date they need is the day after the one shown.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Statutory Sick Pay in last 12 weeks',
    screenshot: 'SSP-in-last-12-weeks',
    why:
    '
   If they do not receive Statutory Sick Pay now, but they did recently, then that will affect when their claim can start from. Claimants can backdate up to 3 months.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To see whether users can answer the question, and if they have an SSP1 form to refer back to for the last date of payment.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Statutory Sick Pay end date (if date was in the past)',
    screenshot: 'When-did-SSP-end',
    why:
    '
   To find out when their SSP stopped, so we can work out how far back they can backdate their claim.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To find out whether users know this date, and understand how it will affect their claim. Many users have reported issues with the claim start date, as they do not understand our rules. We can compare this date against their claim start date.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Other statutory payments',
    screenshot: 'Other-statutory-payments',
    why:
    '
   You cannot get New Style ESA alongside these statutory payments for parents.
    ',
    future:
    '
    To test whether users understand how this affects their eligibility.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Planned return to work',
    screenshot: 'Return-to-work',
    why:
    '
   Some claimants might have an imminent return date - for example if they broke their leg a couple of months ago and have only now realised they were entitled to any money. If they provide their planned return date then we will know whether they are going to be on the benefit for long.
    ',
    future:
    '
    This is not in the clerical form, and there were a number of differing opinions about whether we need to ask this at all. When we tested this during alpha, most claimants did not feel confident giving a date. They felt they would be held to it. We have agreed to test this during private beta to see if this is something users know or feel comfortable giving to us.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Claim start date',
    screenshot: 'Claim-date',
    why:
    '
   A claimant can backdate their claim by up to 3 months, if they have evidence to cover it and were not getting any statutory payments at the time.
    ',
    future:
    '
    Research has shown that this is a difficult question. On the clerical form, users often leave it blank or put things like ‘ASAP’. This is not possible on the digital form and they need to put a full date. We know that users struggle to understand the rules around backdating and eligibility and that changing their claim start dates later can be laborious and time consuming for processors. At the moment we are just trying to explain the basic rules and reassure users that we will check it before it is sent (users got nervous when giving a date that they are not sure is right - they know they might have to pay money back if they do it wrong). We have tried a new design where in some cases we give the user the date we think they can claim from, based on information they have given us - for example, the end date for their SSP. It needs more testing, and discussion with stakeholders to make sure we do not misadvise claimants.
    '
  },
  {
    title: 'Worked abroad',
    screenshot: 'Worked-abroad',
    why:
    '
   The claimant might have paid equivalent social security contributions in another country that we can take into account for the benefit. If they have worked abroad in the last 5 years, processors will send an ESA31 form for more detail about where they worked and refer their claim to the International Pensions Centre.

    future:
    '
    This is not on the clerical form and there are some differing opinions on whether we should ask it of everyone.

  At the start of private beta, claimants with pensions are being sent to apply through the clerical route. We have kept the questions there in case anyone with a pension gets through.

We also need to check that they can add details of foreign pension providers, if needed, and that they understand they can add another pension later. At the start of private beta, we should also see how the message about the question being optional affects what claimants give.  In a future iteration (version 10) we allow them to put a provider from outside the UK, because they may have worked and set up the pension abroad.

    why:
    '
   Permenant health insurance is treated like a pension. So if a user gets more than £85 a week from their combined pensions and health insurance, half of the amount is taken off their ESA payment.
    ',
    future:
    '
  Research has shown that users do not understand what permanent health insurance is. It is mostly an industry term and ‘income protection insurance’ is much better known. However, income protection covers many things so we need to still make sure that we ask questions or provide hints that get across the specific type of insurance we‘re interested in (set up by an employer who you have since left and who paid more than half of the premiums). Some users mistake permanent health insurance for private health insurance, like BUPA. We get very few claims through where the claimant has this type of insurance, but this can mean that processors are not completely clear on the rules themselves as they deal with them so infrequently and there are <a href="https://www.benefitsandwork.co.uk/forum/10-dla-esa-queries-results/101829-esa-and-phi-claims">reports online of people having money unfairly deducted</a>. We have an alternative question flow in <a href="https://newstyleesa.herokuapp.com/apply/v10a/insurance">prototype version 10a</a> which uses clearer language and asks more questions to direct people away who do not have the right type of insurance.

  {
    title: 'Permanent health insurance details',
    screenshot: 'Permanent-health-insurance-details',
    why:
    '
   To find out where they get their permanent health insurance from in case we need to contact their provider. This also populates the insurance provider name in follow up questions.
    ',
    future:
    '
  To check they know these details and analyse what answers people can give while the questions are optional. We also need to check that they understand they can add more than one policy. We have an alternative question flow in <a href="https://newstyleesa.herokuapp.com/apply/v10a/insurance-detail">version 10 of the prototype</a>. On the alternative version of this screen, we use ‘insurance details’ not ‘permanent health insurance details’. We also allow them to put a provider from outside the UK, because they may have worked and set up the policy abroad.

    why:
    '
   To find out if the claimant paid most of the premiums themselves. If they did, we disregard it.
    ',
    future:
    '
    The word ‘premium’ is not plain English and can be confusing. They also may not know excatly what percentage they paid. In the alternative version (version 10) we tried ‘Did your previous employer pay more than half towards this insurance?’ with some additional hint text that explains who they can check with if they are not sure. There is an ‘I‘m not sure’option in the MVP so it would be good to track how many people choose this and need a conversation with a processor.

  {
    title: 'Still working for the employer',
    screenshot: 'Still-employed-with-policy',
    why:
    '
   If they are still employed by the employer that set up the policy, then the money is counted as sick pay rather than permanent health insurance and therefore has no affect on the benefit.
    ',
    future:
    '
  To check comprehension and whether they can enter a precise date. There is an alternative question flow in version 10 which asks for information about insurance in stages and removes the need for this question - it asks them first who set up the policy (me, previous employer, current employer), and they‘re only asked about premiums if they selected ‘previous employer’.

  {

  {
    title: 'Bank details',
    screenshot: 'Bank-details',
    why:
    '
   We need to know how to pay them if their claim is successful. We cannot ask this later as they cannot do this at the jobcentre and they may not have to return later forms. It is also mandatory in JSAPS.
    ',
    future:
    '
  Users are sometimes surprised that they have to enter bank details when they don‘t know yet whether they are eligible. In the MVP, we have added some more hint text to reassure how we use this information so we should test whether this helps and if it does not it might be worth considering whether we could ask at a point where they have some reassurance that they are eligible.

  {
    title: 'Consent to sharing the results of an assessment',
    screenshot: 'Consent-assessment',
    why:
    '
   To find out if the claimant gives consent for us to write to their doctor and tell them the outcome of the claimant’s assessment.

    future:
    '
  This has not been thoroughly tested for comprehension. It went in late and we were advised that we could not change the content at all, not even for style. However, we can test this during private beta and give feedback to the Data Protection, Legal, Strategy and Comms teams if anything need to change. In particular we need to think about introducing the Work Capability Assessment earlier to see if that eases any surprise or concern. Some users see that saying no has no affect on their claim at all, and wonder why we are asking at all. For others, the idea of telling their doctor about our assessment makes them uncomfortable - like it might change how their doctor views their condition, or like we are challenging their doctors assessment of their condition. Just in terms of basic content issues, there are some style issues, it is longer than we would like, we could improve the phrasing, and we could work on the use of a statement as a question. It is also worth considering whether this letter that we need consent to send is actually needed since it has no affect on their claim.

    why:
    '
  To give users an opportunity to review the information they have entered and change it if necessary.
    ',
    future:
    '
To explore the user flow from and back to the Check Answers screen, particularly for any journeys where their change would introduce new not-previously answered questions and for the looping ‘add another’ journeys. The MVP design mostly follows our <a href="/public/images/check-your-answers-flow.PNG">proposed flow</a> except for a ‘Cancel’ button which we could not do because of limitations with the CASA framework. We are hoping after some CASA upgrades we will reach a point where we can add the cancel button rather than using the back link to send the user back to where they were. We should also look into having only 1 ‘Change’ link per screen. Some screens with lots of fields or reveals on them have a couple of ‘Change’ links like ‘Home address’ and ‘Alternative contact address’.

  To observe behaviour and see if it makes claimants nervous or stops them submitting. The content is also very similar to the content of their claimant commitment so it might be worth considering whether they need to commit to these things twice.

  {
    title: 'Confirmation',
    screenshot: 'Done',
    why:
    '
   To confirm that the application form is submitted and tell the user what to do next.
    ',
    future:
    '
To explore whether users know that the process of applying is not yet completed and that they still have to go to an appointment. We have tried an alternative design in version 10 which gets across that the user has completed the ‘first part’ of the process and sets out next steps. We also need to check if this is enough of a confirmation. Some users expect a text message or email. Users also cannot properly bookmark this page (as it is dynamic, based on their answers) which means they cannot go back to their confirmation to check what they need at their appointment. In the early stages of private beta, a user submitted twice because their phone battery died as they submitted and they were not sure if it had gone through so some sort of notification would have helped them. We need to watch this through private beta to see if this happens several times and what would help.
