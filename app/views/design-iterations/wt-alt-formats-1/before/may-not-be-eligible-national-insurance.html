        <p class="govuk-body">If you’ve not made enough National Insurance contributions over the last 2 to 3 years, you may not be eligible to get New Style ESA payments. But you may be able to get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-credits" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">National Insurance credits (opens in a new window)</a>.</p>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">New Style ESA gives you Class 1 credits, which can help to fill gaps in your National Insurance record and may help you qualify for certain benefits, including New Style Jobseeker’s Allowance and the State Pension.</p>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">If you’re on a low income or out of work, you can check if you’re eligible for Universal Credit. This will give you a regular payment and Class 3 credits. They count towards your State Pension only.</p>
