    {# BAU Evidence #}

    <p class="govuk-body">You need to provide medical evidence from the start of your claim. You have asked for your claim to start on ((claim start date)).</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can send us a fit note (also called a sick note or a statement of fitness for work) using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/send-fit-note" target="_blank">Send Your Fit Note service (opens in new tab).</a></p>

        <span class="govuk-details__summary-text">
          Send us another type of medical evidence
        </span>
      </summary>
      <div class="govuk-details__text">
        <p class="govuk-body">As well as fit notes, we also accept these medical certificates:</p>
    
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Med10 (if you're in hospital for treatment that lasts more than 7 days)</li>
          <li>MATB1 (if you're pregnant but cannot get Statutory Maternity Pay or Maternity Allowance)</li>
          <li>CF73 (if you've been admitted to a psychiatric hospital)</li>
          <li>SR1 (a form completed and sent to us by a doctor, consultant or specialist nurse. This has replaced the DS1500 form)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Other forms of evidence might include a doctor's statement, consultant's report or Local Authority notice. </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Send your medical evidence to:</p>

      </div>
    </details>
    <p class="govuk-body">Medical evidence always needs to be in date. When your fit note or certificate expires, you need to get and send us a new one. We will tell you when you can stop sending it.</p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Claimant Commitment appointment</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We will aim to contact you by ((contact date)) to book your 'Claimant Commitment' appointment. This is usually held over the phone.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">During this appointment we will ask you to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>confirm your identity</li>
      <li>agree to tell us if your circumstances change</li>
      <li>accept an agreement that sets out what you can expect of us, and what we expect of you. This is called a Claimant Commitment</li>
      
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">We may also ask some questions about your health to help us understand your situation. You will not need to give us a detailed medical history at this appointment. We will ask for this at a later stage.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You need to complete this appointment before you can get New Style ESA.</p>
